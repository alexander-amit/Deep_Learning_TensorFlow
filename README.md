## Deep_Learning_TensorFlow
Step by step details:
1. Load_data.py - Read the data from which tf has to be trained and tested
2. Model.py - create the model of Deep_learning tf
3. Loop.py - Iterate the model on traing_Data and testing_data for training and increasing the accuracy
4. Model_logging.py - Log the progress of model in a file.
5. Model_check_point.py - save the trained model for future use.
6. Load_check_point.py - load the saved check_point trained model and use it
